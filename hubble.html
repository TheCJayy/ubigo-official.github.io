    <h1>What is Hubble?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hubble is a website designed to help small content creators find other creators to collaborate with. You can make an account which is linked to your channel, and browse creators, filtering your search to find people of a similar video type, similar channel size or specific skillset. Collaboration requests will be directed your account, which you can accept or decline.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="paragraph">
    <h1>Why use it?</h1>
    <p>Hubble is easy to use and can connect you with people in the community that would be otherwise hard to find. How many times have you spent hours hunting for a collab partner on discord, only to find that they aren't serious enough, haven't established a channel, have poor quality content? Hubble can stop you from wasting time and allow you to actually focus on your content creation.</p>

        <p>Successful projects lead to increased ratings, which other viewers can see when pursuing collab partners to help them determine who has the right amount of experience. Based on your abilities, you can also set your specialities, which helps viewers find somebody with the right skillset for the job. Buttons are much like badges: you are awarded them for proving your persistance or your authenticity to make sure that searchers find a person who is safe to work with, and together, these make for a search system that you can use to connect to the community of content creators. Traits are one of <b>{INSERT TRAITS HERE}</b>. You are given traits based of your content and {SOMETHING TO INSERT HERE}. For example you are given the "Fun" trait if your main quality is funness, you may also get one of the bonus traits such as trusworthiness. More can be found out about traits at the <a href="/sorry.html">Official Hubble Website</a></p>-->
